# rebirth
This is my iteration 

I want to create software that people love. 

Ruby, R, Krita, Python, Javascript, 

C, Linux, Vim, Emacs and others come to mind. 

Why can't we all get along? 

The Unix way. 

Here's to keeping it simple. 

I want to think long and hard about what software I use. 

Vue seems like a simple answer. Svelte also sounds nice. 

Next.js and React are what I know best. 

I want to learn ruby and beyond. 

Wish me luck! 

I think I'll start with vue.
